            title: "Decide on Meeting Format and Frequency",
            content: "Will your meetings be in person, online, or a mix of both? Consider the needs of your members when deciding on the format. Decide how often to meet â€” monthly meetings work well for most book clubs, as they give everyone enough time to finish the book."

            title: "Choose Your First Book Carefully",
            content: "For the first book, choose something accessible and interesting, but not overly challenging. A good starter book will help build momentum and encourage discussion. You could even have members vote on a list of books to get everyone involved from the beginning."

            title: "Set Ground Rules",
            content: "Setting a few basic rules helps keep the book club enjoyable for everyone. Consider discussing things like attendance expectations, participation, how books will be chosen in the future, and how long each meeting will last. These guidelines will help maintain a respectful and engaging environment."

            title: "Prepare Discussion Questions",
            content: "Discussion questions can help steer the conversation and make it easier for quieter members to participate. You can prepare questions in advance or encourage members to bring their own questions to each meeting. Many books also come with discussion guides that can be a great resource."

            title: "Add Fun Extras",

You could have themed snacks or drinks based on the book, play a trivia game about the story, or give small prizes for participation. These extras can make the experience memorable and keep members excited about coming back."
